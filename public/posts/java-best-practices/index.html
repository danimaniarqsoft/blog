Consider static factory methods instead of constructors


One advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they have names.
A second advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors,
they are not required to create a new object each time they’re invoked
A third advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors,
they can return an object of any subtype of their return type.
A fourth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned
object can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters.
A fifth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned object
need not exist when the class containing the method is written
