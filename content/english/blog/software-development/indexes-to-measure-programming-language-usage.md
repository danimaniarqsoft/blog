## Introduction

The world of programming languages is vast and ever-evolving. Developers, tech companies, and educators constantly seek insights into which languages are most used, most loved, or most in demand. But how do we measure this popularity and usage? Several organizations have developed indexes and surveys to track the global usage trends of programming languages, each using different methodologies and data sources. Understanding these indexes helps inform hiring decisions, learning paths, and software planning strategies.

## A Brief History of Programming Languages

Programming languages have existed since the dawn of computing. The first high-level language, **Fortran**, emerged in the 1950s to support scientific and mathematical computations. Then came **COBOL** for business processes and **Lisp** for symbolic computing.

The 1970s introduced **C**, a foundational systems language, and **Pascal** for teaching. **C++** and **Java** became prominent in the 1990s as object-oriented programming rose to prominence. The early 2000s saw the rise of **JavaScript** with the explosion of web development, and **Python** rapidly gained popularity thanks to its simplicity and the rise of data science and AI.

Today, the landscape includes dozens of languages, each optimized for different domains‚Äîfrom **TypeScript** in modern web development to **Rust** in systems programming, and **Go** for scalable backend services.

## Main Indexes to Measure Programming Language Usage

| # | Index Name | Description | Data Sources | Update Frequency | Website |
|---|------------|-------------|--------------|------------------|---------|
| 1 | **TIOBE Index** | Measures language popularity via search engine visibility. | Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Wikipedia, YouTube, etc. | Monthly | [tiobe.com](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) |
| 2 | **RedMonk Ranking** | Correlates GitHub usage and Stack Overflow discussion. | GitHub + Stack Overflow | Biannual | [redmonk.com](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/) |
| 3 | **GitHub Octoverse** | Ranks languages by usage in GitHub repos and contributions. | GitHub commits, PRs, issues | Annual | [octoverse.github.com](https://octoverse.github.com/) |
| 4 | **Stack Overflow Developer Survey** | Tracks languages most used, loved, or sought after by developers. | Survey of 90K+ developers | Annual | [insights.stackoverflow.com](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) |
| 5 | **PYPL Index** | Ranks based on Google Trends of tutorial searches. | Google Trends | Monthly | [pypl.github.io](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) |
| 6 | **JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Survey** | Insight into professional tool/language usage trends. | Global developer survey | Annual | [jetbrains.com](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2024) |
| 7 | **IEEE Spectrum Ranking** | Customizable by domain (web, enterprise, embedded). | GitHub, Reddit, Twitter, Stack Overflow, Google | Annual | [spectrum.ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages) |
| 8 | **HackerRank Developer Skills Report** | Compares what devs know vs. what employers want. | HackerRank data + surveys | Annual | [hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/research/developer-skills) |
| 9 | **CodinGame Developer Survey** | Tracks language popularity via gamified coding platform and survey. | CodinGame platform + survey | Annual | [codingame.com](https://www.codingame.com/work/blog/developer-survey-2024) |

## üîç What Is the Most Used Language Today?

Based on a convergence of these indexes, **JavaScript** is still the most *ubiquitously used* programming language in the world. It consistently tops rankings in GitHub, Stack Overflow, RedMonk, and the Octoverse. Its reach across **frontend, backend (Node.js), mobile (React Native), and desktop (Electron)** makes it nearly unavoidable for any software developer.

That said, **Python** is arguably the fastest-growing and most *versatile* language, with dominance in **data science, machine learning, scripting, automation, and education**. Its readability and massive ecosystem have made it a preferred first language and a staple in modern AI workflows.

In enterprise, **Java** and **C#** remain strong due to legacy systems and enterprise-grade tooling. **Go** and **Rust** are climbing for their performance and simplicity in cloud-native and systems applications.

## üîç What Language We Most Change Today?

**PHP** has had a long and polarizing history in the software development world. Originally created in 1994, PHP powered some of the most significant web applications and frameworks‚Äîincluding **WordPress**, **Drupal**, and **Laravel**‚Äîmaking it one of the most deployed backend languages on the internet.

Despite criticisms about its design and security issues in its early versions, PHP has matured significantly. With the advent of **PHP 7 and 8**, performance has improved dramatically, and modern features like strong typing, JIT compilation, and better error handling have made it more competitive.

However, in greenfield projects, PHP is now often bypassed in favor of more modern stacks like **Node.js**, **Python**, or **Go**. While it's no longer the "cutting-edge" choice, PHP remains a robust and viable option for many web applications.
