Graphs are fundamental data structures in computer science, used to model pairwise relations between objects. They are ubiquitous in applications ranging from social networks and the web to transportation, compiler construction, and bioinformatics.

## 1. Introduction to Graphs

### **Definition**

A **graph** \(G = (V, E)\) consists of:

* \(V\): a set of **vertices** or **nodes**
* \(E\): a set of **edges** representing connections between nodes

### **Types of Graphs**

* **Undirected vs Directed**: In undirected graphs, edges have no direction; in directed graphs (digraphs), they do.
* **Weighted vs Unweighted**: Weighted graphs assign a cost to each edge.
* **Cyclic vs Acyclic**: Acyclic graphs do not contain cycles.
* **Simple vs Multigraph**: Simple graphs have at most one edge between any pair of nodes.

---

## 2. Graph Representations

### **Adjacency Matrix**

* A 2D matrix \(A[i][j]\) where value denotes the presence (and possibly weight) of an edge.
* Suitable for dense graphs.

### **Adjacency List**

* An array or map of lists where each vertex points to its adjacent vertices.
* Preferred for sparse graphs.

---

## 3. Fundamental Graph Operations

* **Add Vertex**
* **Add Edge**
* **Remove Vertex**
* **Remove Edge**
* **Check Adjacency**
* **Get Neighbors**

---

## 4. Graph Traversal Algorithms

### **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

* Explores neighbors level by level.
* Uses a queue.
* Time Complexity: \(O(V + E)\)
* Applications: Shortest path in unweighted graphs, web crawling.

### **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

* Explores as deep as possible before backtracking.
* Uses recursion or a stack.
* Time Complexity: \(O(V + E)\)
* Applications: Topological sort, detecting cycles.

---

## 5. Shortest Path Algorithms

### **Dijkstra's Algorithm**

* Finds the shortest path from a source to all other vertices in weighted graphs with non-negative weights.
* Time Complexity: \(O((V + E) \log V)\) with a priority queue.

### **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**

* Handles graphs with negative weights.
* Detects negative weight cycles.
* Time Complexity: \(O(VE)\)

### **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**

* All-pairs shortest path algorithm.
* Time Complexity: \(O(V^3)\)

### **A* Search Algorithm*\*

* Heuristic-driven pathfinding algorithm.
* Common in AI and games.

---

## 6. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithms

### **Prim's Algorithm**

* Builds MST by expanding the smallest edge.
* Time Complexity: \(O((V + E) \log V)\)

### **Kruskal's Algorithm**

* Sorts edges and builds MST using a Union-Find structure.
* Time Complexity: \(O(E \log E)\)

---

## 7. Graph Coloring

### **Definition**

Assigning colors to vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

### **Applications**

* Register allocation
* Scheduling
* Map coloring

### **Algorithms**

* Greedy Coloring
* Welsh-Powell Algorithm
* Backtracking-based methods

---

## 8. Topological Sorting

### **Definition**

Ordering of vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for every edge \((u, v)\), \(u\) comes before \(v\).

### **Algorithms**

* DFS-based method
* Kahn's Algorithm

### **Applications**

* Task scheduling
* Dependency resolution (e.g., build systems)

---

## 9. Connectivity and Components

* **Connected Components**: DFS or BFS can identify connected subgraphs.
* **Strongly Connected Components** (SCCs): Kosaraju's or Tarjan's algorithms.
* **Articulation Points** and **Bridges**: DFS-based algorithms to find critical nodes and links.

---

## 10. Advanced Topics

### **Graph Isomorphism**

* Determine whether two graphs are structurally identical.

### **Network Flow**

* **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm**
* **Edmonds-Karp Algorithm**
* Applications: Matching, bipartite graphs, circulation problems

### **Eulerian and Hamiltonian Paths**

* **Eulerian Path**: Visits every edge exactly once
* **Hamiltonian Path**: Visits every vertex exactly once

---

## 11. Applications of Graphs

* **Computer Networks**: Routing and data flow
* **Social Networks**: Friend recommendation, influence analysis
* **Search Engines**: PageRank algorithm
* **Compilers**: Control flow graphs, data flow analysis
* **Bioinformatics**: Protein interaction, genome assembly

---

## Conclusion

Graphs are a powerful abstraction in computer science. Mastery of graph theory and algorithms enables practitioners to model complex relationships and solve a wide array of real-world problems. Whether through traversal, optimization, or analysis, graphs form the foundation of many critical computational tasks.
