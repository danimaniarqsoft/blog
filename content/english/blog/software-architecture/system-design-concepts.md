System design is a foundational skill in software engineering that encompasses the architectural structuring of complex systems to meet specified requirements for scalability, performance, reliability, and maintainability. It addresses both the high-level organization of systems (architectural design) and low-level components (detailed design), bridging the gap between theoretical principles and practical implementation.

As modern systems scale to serve millions of users, a sound understanding of system design principles becomes critical for engineers, architects, and developers building distributed systems, microservices, and data-intensive applications.

## A brief history of System Design

The origins of system design trace back to the 1960s and 1970s, as computer systems grew in complexity with the rise of mainframes and early networking. Key milestones include:

- **1970s:** Software engineering is formalized; structured programming and modular design are emphasized.
- **1980s–90s:** Emergence of Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and the Rational Unified Process (RUP).
- **2000s–Present:** Rise of distributed systems, microservices, and cloud-native architectures driven by internet-scale applications.

Notably, system design matured alongside advancements in software architecture, operating systems, networking, and database technologies.

## Core Concepts of System Design

### 1. Scalability

{{< image src="images/posts/software-architecture/system-design/scalability.png" caption="" alt="" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title="image title"  webp="false" >}}

#### Introduction
Scalability is a foundational pillar in system design. It ensures that a system can handle increased loads gracefully without a complete architectural overhaul. As systems grow in user base and data volume, they must remain responsive and functional.

#### Definition
Scalability refers to the capability of a system to increase its capacity and accommodate more workload without sacrificing performance. This concept can be categorized into vertical scaling (increasing resources on a single node) and horizontal scaling (adding more nodes). A scalable system maintains efficiency and stability regardless of growing user demands. Scalability becomes essential in modern cloud environments, where traffic surges and massive data throughput are common. Systems must be built with flexibility, elasticity, and distributed architecture to support both planned and sudden increases in usage.

#### Problem It Solves
Without scalability, systems become bottlenecks under heavy load, leading to degraded performance or crashes, ultimately resulting in poor user experience and revenue loss.

#### How to Solve It
- Implement horizontal scaling with load balancers.
- Use stateless services to ease replication.
- Apply sharding and partitioning on databases.
- Utilize elastic cloud infrastructures.

#### Violations and Fixes
1. **Violation**: A monolithic application crashes during a product launch.
   - **Solution**: Refactor into microservices and deploy behind a load balancer.
2. **Violation**: A single database node slows down due to high read/write traffic.
   - **Solution**: Introduce read replicas and caching (e.g., Redis).

#### Related Concepts
- Elasticity
- Load balancing
- Performance tuning

#### Tools/Methods

### 2. Availability

{{< image src="images/posts/software-architecture/system-design/availability.png" caption="" alt="" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title=""  webp="false" >}}
#### Introduction
Availability is the measure of a system’s uptime and readiness to serve users. High availability is crucial for critical systems that must operate continuously without interruption.

#### Definition
Availability refers to the proportion of time a system remains operational and accessible. It is typically represented as a percentage (e.g., 99.99% uptime). High availability (HA) systems ensure redundancy, failover mechanisms, and minimal downtime. They often involve multiple servers, replicated databases, and geographically distributed data centers. Availability is critical for user trust, especially in banking, healthcare, or e-commerce platforms where outages can lead to serious consequences.

#### Problem It Solves
Availability addresses service outages and system downtime, which can result from hardware failure, software bugs, or maintenance activities.

#### How to Solve It
- Use redundant infrastructure (active-active or active-passive clusters).
- Implement load balancers and health checks.
- Replicate data across regions.

#### Violations and Fixes
1. **Violation**: An online store becomes unreachable during maintenance.
   - **Solution**: Deploy zero-downtime deployment strategies with blue-green deployments.
2. **Violation**: A backend API fails due to a single EC2 instance crash.
   - **Solution**: Implement auto-scaling groups with multiple zones.

### 3. Consistency

#### Introduction
Consistency ensures that all users see the same data across a distributed system. It is a key challenge in the design of modern data systems.

#### Definition
Consistency is the guarantee that every read receives the most recent write or an error. In distributed systems, data may be replicated for fault tolerance and performance, but consistency ensures the correctness of that replication. Models vary from strong consistency (linearizability) to eventual consistency, where updates propagate over time. The choice depends on the use case and latency constraints. Consistency is central in financial systems where even minor discrepancies can cause significant issues.

#### Problem It Solves
Inconsistent views of data across nodes can result in incorrect behavior, such as duplicate orders or mismatched inventory levels.

#### How to Solve It
- Use consensus algorithms like Paxos or Raft.
- Apply quorum-based reads/writes.
- Leverage transaction logs and atomic commits.

#### Violations and Fixes
1. **Violation**: Users see different account balances from separate servers.
   - **Solution**: Enforce strong consistency with quorum reads/writes.
2. **Violation**: Product inventory shows 5 items, but all are sold.
   - **Solution**: Apply distributed locks or transactions.

#### Related Concepts
- CAP Theorem
- Eventual Consistency
- Atomicity

#### Tools/Methods
