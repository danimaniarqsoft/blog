## Introduction

Evaluation is a crucial step in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline, assessing a model's "goodness," primarily its performance on unseen data. Success hinges on using the right metrics and following a proper evaluation process. Metrics vary by NLP task and pipeline phase (model building, deployment, production), with machine learning (ML) metrics common in early phases and business metrics added in production to gauge business impact.

Evaluations are broadly categorized into two types:
1. Intrinsic Evaluation
2. Extrinsic Evaluation

## Intrinsic Evaluation: 
 - Focuses on intermediary objectives and ML-specific metrics.   
 - Assumes the availability of a test set with "ground truth" labels (human-annotated correct answers), which can be binary, short phrases, or full text.   
 - Model output is compared against these labels, and metrics are calculated based on matches or mismatches.   
 - Can often be automated, but for subjective tasks like machine translation or summarization, full automation is challenging.   

**Common Intrinsic Metrics & Applications:**
- **Accuracy:** Fraction of correct predictions (e.g., sentiment classification, natural language inference).
- **Precision:** How exact positive predictions are (e.g., disease prediction, where false positives are costly).
- **Recall:** How well the model identifies all positive cases (e.g., e-commerce search, information retrieval).
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing completeness and exactness (e.g., most classification tasks, entity extraction).
- **AUC (Area Under the Curve):** Measures model quality independent of the prediction threshold, useful for finding optimal thresholds.
- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank):** Evaluates ranked responses based on correctness probability (e.g., article search, e-commerce search).
- **MAP (Mean Average Precision):** Calculates mean precision across ranked retrieval results (e.g., information retrieval).
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) & MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error):** For real-value prediction/regression tasks (e.g., temperature, stock price prediction).
- **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) & METEOR:** Capture n-gram overlap and text quality for generated text, primarily machine translation (METEOR improves on BLEU by allowing synonyms/stemmed words).
- **ROUGE:** Measures recall for generated text against reference text, mainly used for summarization.
- **Perplexity:** A probabilistic measure of a language model's "confusion," used for language models and generation tasks like dialog.
- **Limitations:** Automated evaluation for text generation can be imperfect because multiple correct variations may not be captured in ground truth labels, leading to false negatives (e.g., "filberts" vs. "hazelnuts"). This often necessitates human evaluation, which is expensive.   
- **Visual Aids:** Confusion matrices are commonly used for classification tasks to inspect actual vs. predicted output and compute metrics. Ranking tasks use metrics like MRR and MAP, but also "Recall at rank K."
        
## Extrinsic Evaluation:   
- Focuses on evaluating model performance against the **final business objective**.   
- Crucial for industrial projects where AI models aim to solve real-world business problems (e.g., an email ranking model saving user time).   
- A model performing well on intrinsic metrics but failing business objectives is not considered successful.   
- Requires setting up business metrics and measurement processes correctly from the project's start.   
- **Relationship with Intrinsic Evaluation:** Intrinsic evaluation acts as a proxy for extrinsic evaluation, serving as a more cost-effective preliminary step. Only consistently good intrinsic results warrant proceeding to the more expensive extrinsic evaluation, which often involves external stakeholders and end-users.   
- Poor intrinsic results usually imply poor extrinsic results. However, strong intrinsic performance doesn't guarantee extrinsic success, as business failure could stem from incorrect metrics, unsuitable data, or flawed expectations.
        
In summary, evaluating NLP models involves a combination of intrinsic (ML-focused) and extrinsic (business-impact-focused) methods. While intrinsic metrics provide a technical gauge, extrinsic evaluation ultimately determines a model's real-world success and value.
