| **Raw Frequency:**                                      | The absolute count of a term in a document                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Term Frequency (TF):**                                | The raw frequency of a term divided by the total number of terms in the document. This normalizes the frequency for document length.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):** | A more advanced metric that weighs the term frequency by its inverse document frequency (the logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents containing the term). This gives higher weight to terms that are frequent in a specific document but rare across the entire corpus. |
