## Introduction

In the world of machine learning, the quality of your features directly determines the quality of your results—a principle known as "garbage in, garbage out." For Natural Language Processing (NLP), this means that converting raw text into a numerical format, or **text representation**, is one of the most critical steps in the entire pipeline.

While other data types like images, videos, and speech have straightforward mathematical representations, text is more complex. A good text representation scheme must not only convert words into numbers but also capture the meaning, grammar, and context of the text. This article explores various methods for doing just that, from simple approaches to state-of-the-art techniques.

## The Foundation: Vector Space Models (VSM)

At the heart of all text representation schemes lies the **Vector Space Model (VSM)**. This is a mathematical model that represents text as vectors of numbers. This approach allows us to perform algebraic operations on text, most notably measuring the similarity between two texts using metrics like **cosine similarity** or Euclidean distance. The effectiveness of any given representation scheme depends on how well its resulting vectors capture the linguistic properties of the text.

## Basic Vectorization: A Simple Start

Initial text representation methods are straightforward but have significant limitations. They treat words as discrete, atomic units, which prevents them from capturing the nuances of language. These traditional methods are straightforward but have notable limitations, including creating high-dimensional, sparse vectors and the inability to capture semantic relationships or handle new, unseen words (**Out-Of-Vocabulary**, or **OOV**, words).

- **One-Hot Encoding**: This simple method assigns a unique integer ID to each word in a vocabulary. Each word is then represented as a long, sparse vector with a `1` at its corresponding ID and `0`s everywhere else.
    
    - **Pros**: Easy to understand and implement.
        
    - **Cons**: Creates very large, sparse vectors, which are computationally inefficient and can lead to overfitting. It also fails to capture any semantic relationships between words and cannot handle new words not in the original vocabulary (**out-of-vocabulary** or OOV problem).
        
{{< notice "tip" >}}
These days, one-hot encoding scheme is seldom used.

- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: This technique represents a document as a vector of word counts, completely ignoring word order and context. The intuition is that documents with similar word distributions belong to the same "bag" or category.
    
    - **Pros**: Simple and creates fixed-length representations for documents of any length. It also captures some level of document similarity based on shared vocabulary.
        
    - **Cons**: Loses all word order information, treats different words with similar meanings as distinct, and suffers from the OOV problem.
        
- **Bag of N-Grams (BoN)**: An extension of BoW, BoN addresses the lack of word order by representing text as a collection of sequences of `n` words (n-grams). This helps capture some context, but it also rapidly increases the dimensionality and sparsity of the vectors.
    
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)**: This is a more sophisticated method that weighs words based on their importance. It measures how often a word appears in a document (**Term Frequency**) and how rare that word is across the entire corpus (**Inverse Document Frequency**). The product of these two scores highlights words that are important to a specific document but not common everywhere.
    
    - **Pros**: Effectively identifies important, descriptive words.
        
    - **Cons**: Still suffers from high dimensionality and sparsity, and like the other methods, has difficulty capturing the subtle relationships between words.


{{< notice "tip" >}}
Even today, TF-IDF continues to be a popular representation scheme for many NLP tasks, especially the initial versions of the solution.

These basic approaches share three fundamental drawbacks: they are **discrete**, creating sparse and high-dimensional vectors; they struggle to capture **semantic relationships**; and they cannot handle **OOV words**.

## Modern Solutions: Distributed Representations

Distributed representations are a powerful approach to text representation that addresses the limitations of older, basic vectorization methods. Unlike those older methods, which produce sparse, high-dimensional vectors, distributed representation models use neural networks to create **dense, low-dimensional vectors** that are both computationally efficient and rich in semantic information.

The core of this approach is the **Distributional Hypothesis**, which states that words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. These models learn to represent words as vectors, or **embeddings**, in a way that captures these relationships. A landmark example is **Word2vec**, a model that can capture complex analogies like: King−Man+Woman≈Queen.

### Key Concepts in Distributed Representations

- **Distributional Similarity**: The idea that a word's meaning is defined by its context, not its literal definition. For example, in "NLP rocks," the meaning of "rocks" is inferred from the surrounding words, not from its literal definition as a stone.
- **Distributional Representation**: This refers to older methods like TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words that are based on the distributional hypothesis but result in high-dimensional and sparse vectors.
- **Distributed Representation**: This is a more modern approach that compresses the high-dimensional vectors from distributional representations into a compact, low-dimensional, and dense format.
- **Embedding**: The process of mapping a word or text from its high-dimensional representation to a distributed, low-dimensional vector space.

### Training and Using Word Embeddings

You can obtain word embeddings in two ways: by using **pre-trained models** or by **training your own**.
- **Pre-trained Word Embeddings**: Training a model like Word2vec from scratch is computationally expensive. As a result, many popular embeddings (e.g., **Word2vec, GloVe, fastText**) are available pre-trained on massive text corpora like Wikipedia. These can be downloaded and used directly to get word vectors, providing a strong baseline for many NLP tasks.

{{< notice "tip" >}}
If you’re new to embeddings, always start by using pre-trained word embeddings in your project. Understand their pros and cons, then start thinking of building your own embeddings. Using pre-trained embeddings will quickly give you a strong baseline for the task at hand.
{{< /notice >}}
        
- **Training Your Own Embeddings**: For specific domains or unique needs, you can train your own embeddings using algorithms like Word2vec, which offers two main architectures:
    
    - **Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW)**: Predicts a central word given the words in its surrounding context.
    - **SkipGram**: Predicts the context words given a central word. This is often better for learning representations of rare words.
    - **Hyperparameters**: Key model choices like vector dimensionality (often between 50-500) and context window size are crucial for model quality and often require careful experimentation.

### Handling Words and Texts Beyond Individual Words

A major challenge for many models is the **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) problem**, which occurs when a model encounters a word it has not seen before.

{{< notice "tip" >}}
- If the overlap between **corpus vocabulary** and **embedding vocabulary** is **less than 80%**, we’re unlikely to see good performance from our NLP model.
- A simple approach is to ignore OOV words or assign them random vectors.
- More advanced models like **fastText** address this by learning embeddings for a word's constituent character n-grams. This allows it to generate a vector for a new word by combining the embeddings of its known character n-grams.
{{< /notice >}}
        
To represent larger units of text, like **sentences** or **documents**, a simple but effective strategy is to **average the word embeddings** of all the words within the text. However, a more sophisticated approach is **Doc2vec**, which learns a dedicated **"paragraph vector"** for a given text, in addition to the individual word vectors. This allows Doc2vec to capture the overall meaning and context of a text of any length, making it ideal for tasks like document classification and text recommendation.

## Common Visualization Techniques

Visualization is a critical aspect of text representation, as it allows us to understand complex, high-dimensional data in a human-interpretable way. Since text embeddings are typically vectors with hundreds of dimensions, we can't directly plot them. Therefore, we use dimensionality reduction techniques to project these vectors into a 2D or 3D space.

Common techniques are:

1. **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):** This is one of the most popular algorithms for visualizing high-dimensional data. t-SNE is particularly good at showing the local structure of the data, meaning it's excellent for visualizing how similar words or documents cluster together. It places similar data points close to each other in the low-dimensional space and dissimilar points far apart.
    
2. **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection):** UMAP is another powerful dimensionality reduction technique that is often faster than t-SNE. It's effective at preserving both the local and global structure of the data, which means it can provide a more accurate representation of the overall relationships between clusters of words or documents.
    
3. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique. While it's faster and simpler than t-SNE or UMAP, it's generally less effective at visualizing the complex, non-linear relationships found in text embeddings. PCA is best used for a quick look at the major variations in the data.

## Visualizing Embeddings and Their Meaning

When you visualize text embeddings, you can get powerful insights:

- **Clusters of Words:** You might see that words with similar meanings, like "king," "queen," and "prince," cluster together. This visually confirms the semantic relationships captured by the embedding model.
    
- **Semantic Analogies:** The famous example of "King - Man + Woman ≈ Queen" can be visualized. In the 2D plot, the vector from "Man" to "King" might be roughly parallel to the vector from "Woman" to "Queen."
    
- **Document Relationships:** If you visualize document embeddings, you'll see documents on similar topics, such as sports articles or financial news, forming distinct clusters. This is the basis for document clustering and topic modeling.

## Visualizing Embeddings with t-SNE

Because text feature vectors (embeddings) have too many dimensions to be viewed directly, a technique called **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighboring Embedding)** is used. t-SNE reduces the data's dimensionality to two or three dimensions, allowing it to be plotted. It works by preserving the original structure, so data points that are close in the high-dimensional space remain close in the visual plot.

This visualization is crucial for "eyeballing" the quality of features. For example, t-SNE can show:

- **Clear Clusters:** Words or documents with similar meanings group together.
- **Semantic Relationships:** It can reveal analogies, like the vector relationship between "king" and "queen" being parallel to that between "man" and "woman."
- **Document Embeddings**: The technique also works for document-level embeddings. Visualizing vectors for Wikipedia articles on different topics, for example, shows that articles on the same subject group together, confirming the representation's quality.

## Handcrafted Features for Specific Tasks

While learned representations like embeddings are powerful and general-purpose, some NLP tasks require **handcrafted features** based on domain-specific knowledge. These are features designed manually to capture information that embeddings might miss.

This approach is necessary for specialized applications like:

- **Text Complexity Analysis:** Tools like TextEvaluator use features such as "syntactic complexity" to determine a text's reading level.
- **Automated Essay Scoring:** Systems for the GRE or TOEFL exams need custom features to evaluate writing quality.
- **Grammar Correction:** Tools like Grammarly rely on highly specific, custom-engineered rules and features.

---

## Choosing the Right Approach

The best method depends on the task. General tasks like text classification often work well with learned embeddings. However, specialized tasks like information extraction typically benefit from handcrafted features.

In many real-world industrial systems, a **hybrid approach** is the most effective strategy, combining the strengths of both general learned representations and domain-specific handcrafted features.
