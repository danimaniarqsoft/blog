I am a seasoned software architect and artificial intelligence researcher with over 15 years of experience designing and building complex systems across government agencies, global tech companies, and private industry. My academic foundation began with a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, where I specialized in robotics — blending physical systems with intelligent algorithms. This early work sparked a lifelong interest in automation and intelligent software.

I later earned a Master’s degree in Computer Science with honors, deepening my expertise in software development, algorithms, and distributed systems. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Data Science, focusing on the convergence of natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and explainable AI.

Throughout my career, I’ve authored over 20 copyrighted software systems and contributed to multiple global open-source initiatives. I also hold professional certifications in software development methodologies and architecture. My work has been showcased at international conferences and I’ve been invited to speak on radio and television about the software development lifecycle and the future of AI.

Beyond my technical endeavors, I’ve had the privilege to share insights on radio and television, discussing the software development lifecycle, the future of artificial intelligence, and how to responsibly build and scale technology in society. My open-source contributions have been adopted in research, startups, and education, and I continue to mentor new developers and researchers in the community.

Currently, I focus on large-scale NLP systems and model interpretability — helping machines better understand human language, and ensuring humans can understand machine reasoning.
