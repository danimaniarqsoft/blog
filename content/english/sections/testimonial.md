    title: "The Rise of Vibe Coding and the Future of Programmers"
    content: "In the evolving landscape of software development, a quiet but profound shift is taking place—one that may redefine what it means to be a programmer. The rise of *vibe coding* is signaling a new era where emotional flow, creativity, and intuition are becoming as central to coding as logic, syntax, and architecture. As AI systems increasingly automate low-level programming tasks and even participate in high-level design, the human role is transitioning from code producer to code conductor—a shift that aligns closely with the ethos of vibe coding"

    title: "Beyond the Buzzwords: Rethinking the Software Development Process"
    content: "In the realm of software development, few debates have endured as long—or burned as fiercely—as the one between traditional methodologies and agile practices. For decades, the question of how best to build software has oscillated between rigor and flexibility, planning and iteration, structure and flow. Yet in 2025, this dichotomy feels increasingly obsolete."

    title: "The Case for Hexagonal Architecture in a Fragmented Development World"
    content: "Software development today is defined by paradoxes. Agile vs. traditional. Monoliths vs. microservices. Speed vs. stability. Amidst these tensions, teams search for structures that scale, patterns that last, and architectures that do more than just survive change—they thrive in it. Enter Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters."
