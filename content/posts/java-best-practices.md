The best practices come with experience so this post is going to be updated if new best practices are learned.

* Be clear, not clever
* Keep it short
* Naming is hard, so do it with care
* User switch expressions instead of excessive if statements
* Avoid empty catch blocks
    * Logging the exception
    * Logging the exception and rethrowing it
    * Logging the exception and returning an alternate value
* Choose collections over arrays
